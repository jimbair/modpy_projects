This is a personal project to keep track of any 'small' utilities
I make come up with, write, or need using mod_python with apache.
There should only be single files present that are completely
self contained. Anything larger should get it's own project/repo.

All builds should be stable with the latest Gentoo stable. As of 
today, that is:

apache-2.2.14-r1
mod_python-3.3.1-r1

Recommendations to make these better are welcome. This is my first
attempt to play with mod_python and can use pointers.
